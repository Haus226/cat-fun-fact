INFO     2025-07-29 15:26:53 [scraper.py:106] 🤖 [EO] Cleaned LLM summary: The Echimamish River in central Manitoba, Canada, uniquely originates from a beaver-dam-formed pond and flows divergently east and west from its midpoint. Its flow direction and split point are influenced by beaver-flooded segments, leading to subtle dynamics in flat terrain that challenge scientific understanding. Civil engineer Rob Sowby’s study suggests the river may be in an evolutionary limbo, potentially merging with the upper Hayes River or separating into distinct basins. Historically significant for Indigenous peoples and fur trade routes, the Echimamish connects to the Nelson and Hayes rivers, which discharge into Hudson Bay. Its designation within the Canadian Heritage Rivers System underscores its cultural and ecological importance, despite ongoing ambiguities in its hydrological behavior.
