INFO     2025-07-29 06:42:52 [scraper.py:95] 🤖 [EO] LLM summary: the echimamish river in central manitoba originates from a beaver-dam pond and uniquely flows east and west from its midpoint, connecting the nelson river to the west and the hayes river to the east, which discharge into hudson bay. its split flow pattern, shifting due to beaver activity, creates ambiguities in mapping and historical records, described as “baffling” by scientists. the flat terrain masks subtle flow changes, and the river’s dynamic formation may lead to future merging or separation of its basins. culturally significant to indigenous peoples and historically used by fur traders for access to york factory, the waterways are now part of the canadian heritage rivers system.

INFO     2025-07-29 06:50:02 [scraper.py:96] 🤖 [EO] Cleaned LLM summary: The Echimamish River in Manitoba, Canada, uniquely originates from a beaver-dam-formed pond in flat terrain, flowing east and west from a central split point influenced by beaver activity. Its dual-directional flow, observable in Landsat 9 imagery (May 23, 2025), connects to the Nelson and Hayes Rivers, which drain into Hudson Bay. Geomorphic dynamics and shifting split points complicate scientific analysis, with Rob Sowby’s study suggesting the system remains in transitional formation. Historically significant for Indigenous communities, fur trade routes (via navigable Hayes River), and York Factory (17th century–20th century), it is now part of the Canadian Heritage Rivers System. Current understanding includes unresolved ambiguities in its hydrological evolution due to subtle flow patterns and dynamic beaver-modulated infrastructure.
